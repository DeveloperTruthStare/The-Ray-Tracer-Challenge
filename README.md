# The-Ray-Tracer-Challenge
Creating a ray tracer based on the book "The Ray Tracer Challenge"

# Installation
This uses cmake so simply run

cmake
make
./raytest


This also uses google's gtest as a submodule, so you may need to run
git submodule init --update --recursive

alternatively when cloning the repo you can run
git clone --recursive-submodules https://github.com/DeveloperTruthStare/the-ray-tracer-challenge
